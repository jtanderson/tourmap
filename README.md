# TourMap
---

TL;DR: Ever see a band's tour locations and dates listed
* In
* The
* Most
* Hard-to-read
* Manner
* Possible?
* ...i.e., a list...

Well I have. So I created this library to create and load a sequence of
locations into a google map DOM object quickly and easily, connecting
them with a line and (soon) display the dates in a glanceable manner.

## Wait? What?

This is totally a WIP and, since my primary occupation has not been
coding in a long time, will not be as graceful or up-to-date with
current practice as [your hip project here].
I don't even expect many people to find this useful, but I suspect that
if a curious enough developer finds this and is managing a site for any
group that "tours", then they can make some use of it.

In any case, I'm sure you can make it better, so fork away!
